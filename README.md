# Abstract
Here is a partly completed research topic about information spreading in social networks.
Given number of initial activated points, finding the specific points which can spread the information most.

# Source codes
##  kk.cpp
Application of Karmarkar-karp algorithm, which is a MC based algorithm, simulating for times to obtain a statistical result.
##  competitive.cpp
Extend the kk algorithm to multi information source case. Points can be activated by 2 different sources exclusively.
##  artpoint.cpp / artpoint.py
Introducing the concept of articulation points(points in SCC) to this problem, reducing the choice range of initial points.
##  competitive_ap.cpp(source code missing)
Source code is missing for some reason, but running result shows this algorithm does not work well.

# Library used--- SNAP
SNAP(Stanford Network Analysis Project) is a graph structure library, which is designed to deal with dataset provided from <http://snap.stanford.edu/>.
